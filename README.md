# weather_australia
I used this weather data from 2007-10-31 to 2017-06-24 for 49 cities in Australia to practice plotting with Seaborn and hvplot as part of an assignment for the Thinkful Data Science bootcamp. 

I obtained the data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package) . The data is originally from http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data .
